# StatusCategory

Status category adds some additional meaning to each status: - 'draft': only semantic meaning - 'active': only semantic meaning - 'closed': items with a status in this category will be considered as completed, which contributes to progress calculation (e.g. \"1/3 items completed\").

* `CLOSED` (value: `'closed'`)

* `DRAFT` (value: `'draft'`)
